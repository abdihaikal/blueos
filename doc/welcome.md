Welcome to BlueOS! 

As a course project for Web Development (CS 5610), the purpose of BlueOS is to design a web platform for applications.
BlueOS can be viewed as a web desktop, and each application sits in its own IFrame on the “desktop”.  We have designed
a Task Manager system application to monitor and control all the running apps. We have also built several web 
applications that are handy to use for daily life, including Calculator, Google Map, Weather Forecast, Calendar, etc.

Enjoy your time with BlueOS :)
