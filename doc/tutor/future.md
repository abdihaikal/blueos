BlueOS is far from complete. However, considering it's developed in three months by two people, it is already a greatest course project we've ever made.

It's a pity that we haven't achieved the ambitious goal set in the beginning of the project. Originally, we planned to build a **App Store**-like application, which allows users to manager their app easily. Another big feature we intended to do, is to make a **app navigation** interface, which serves as the entry of all applications.

Besides, there are a lot of places we can improve.

- Currently the dialog can only be resized when cursor is in *east*, *south*, and *southeast* border of the app. We would like it to work in all the directions. The reason is that we used `jquery.resizable` and it does not support this. 

- Login system. We did considered this feature, but instead of building a useless feature that most people will do, we prefer creating more interesting apps.

- We do not support non-boder applications. This feature is also in the original plan, but the dragging issue of such apps is a big problem for us.

- One of the big problems of cloud desktop systems is that they have no hard drives. But now there are many cloud storages out there, such as Google Drive, Box. Why don't we just use these services as our hard disk?

- I plan to rewrite the server-side using node.js -- *I don't always write javascript, but if I do, I use it for everything.*

Finally, I have to admit that this project is just a beautiful toy. I see limited advantages comparing with traditional OS. That's not important, the important thing is that we learned a ton of knowledge during the development process. And this project has made us a better web developer.
